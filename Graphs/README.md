# Graphs

Read the adjacency matrix for a directed graph from the input file and store it in a corresponding data structure.

Find the paths between the nodes given in the query file by traversing the graph using a depth-first graph traversal. Print the paths to the output1.txt text file.

Find the paths between the nodes given in the query file by traversing the graph using a breadth-first graph traversal. Print the paths to the output2.txt text file.
